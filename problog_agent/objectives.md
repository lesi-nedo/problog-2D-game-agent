## My goals are:

Build an agent that uses a knowledge base implemented in Problog to use the uncertainty of the game to make decisions. The agent will be able to play the FightingICE game and make decisions based on the current game state and the knowledge base. The agent will use Prolog to represent the knowledge and Python to interact with the game environment and the Prolog knowledge base.

## Important considerations:

- **Performance**: Ensure that Problog queries are efficient and do not cause significant delays in decision-making.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency between the game state and the knowledge base.
- **Scalability**: Design the knowledge base to handle complex scenarios and large amounts of data.
- **Debugging**: Implement logging and debugging mechanisms to troubleshoot issues in the Problog KB and agent logic.


## Objective of the Agent:

The objective is to win by defeating the opponent in the FightingICE game. The agent should make decisions based on the current game state, the opponent's past actions.
