## Development Plan for Problog-based Agent in FightingICE

### 1. Model Decision-Making with Problog

- **Define Action Space**: List all 56(?) possible actions available in the game.
- **Represent Game State**: Encode the game state (health, position, etc.) as Problog facts.
- **Probabilistic Rules**: Develop probabilistic rules that determine the likelihood of success for each action.

### 3. Optimize for Time Constraints

- **Efficient Inference**: Use approximate inference methods to reduce computation time.
- **Precompute Static Probabilities**: Calculate and store probabilities that don't change during gameplay.
- **Limit Complexity**: Simplify the probabilistic models to ensure decision-making fits within 16.67 ms.

### 4. Organize Knowledge in Problog

- **Character Data**: Encode character-specific abilities and stats as Problog facts.
- **Game Modes**: Represent different modes and their impact on gameplay within the model.
- **Opponent Behavior**: Incorporate historical data or predictions about opponent actions.

### 5. Implement the AI Agent

- **Action Selection Function**: Create a function that selects the best action based on Problog's output.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the AI in the FightingICE environment to ensure proper communication between modules.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track the decision-making time to ensure it stays within the required limit.

### 6. Testing and Refinement Strategies

- **Diverse Opponents**: Test the AI against various characters and playstyles.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Analyze performance data to refine probabilistic models.
- **Automated Testing**: Use scripts to automate matches for large-scale testing.

### 7. Deployment

- **Optimize Code**: Profile and optimize any bottlenecks in the code.
- **Final Testing**: Perform stress tests to ensure stability under various conditions.
- **Documentation**: Document the AI's architecture and decision-making process for future reference.

**Efficient Decision-Making with Problog**

Problog allows for modeling complex decision-making processes with uncertainty, which is essential in dynamic game environments. By leveraging probabilistic logic, the AI can quickly evaluate the best action by:

- **Using Simplified Models**: Keeping models lightweight for faster computation.
- **Approximate Inference**: Applying algorithms that provide good-enough solutions within time constraints.
- **Caching Results**: Storing results of frequent computations to avoid redundant processing.
